// The single source of truth for the repo-intelligence license gate.
//
// Repo-intelligence is a LICENSED capability. The SDK reads repo-intel config from the
// per-run `KodaXOptions.context` that Space builds fresh at each run entry — and Space
// has two such builders (chat: real-session.ts, workflow: workflow-controller.ts) plus
// a few read-only surfaces (version panel, /repointel status, /repointel warm). Every
// one of them MUST make the same entitlement decision. Rather than inline (and risk
// forgetting one — that was a real bypass), they all call the helpers here.
//
// Fail-closed + fault-tolerant: licenseManager.getStatus() re-reads + Ed25519-verifies
// the entitlement and writes state.json (clock observation) on nearly every call. A
// transient disk error must never reject a run/handler — on ANY failure, treat as
// unentitled (repo-intel off).

 * to compile — turning a would-be SILENT bypass (Space keeps emitting a key the SDK no longer
 * reads → engine defaults back to full for unlicensed users, typecheck + tests still green)
